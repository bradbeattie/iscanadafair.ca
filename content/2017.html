    <h1>2017: Swapping Monsef with Gould</h1>

                <p>On January 10, 2017, then Minister of Democratic Institutions Maryam Monsef was replaced by Karina Gould. The year prior, she had spoken passionately on the subject of universal suffrage:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>It is almost incomprehensible that we could ever exclude a full 50% of society from the franchise, that we could exclude indigenous peoples, ethnocultural minority groups, and those who dared to express different beliefs from those of the government of the day. While I am certainly not proud of the history of disenfranchisement in Canada's electoral history, I am truly proud of how far our democracy has evolved into a more inclusive system for all Canadians.</p>
                    <p>Electoral reform is the next step in this evolution toward a more inclusive system.</p>

                <p>Contrast the 2016 speech with Gould's 2017 interview on CBC's Metro Morning. When asked <q>Why is it important that people at the very least believe every vote counts?</q>, Gould had the following to say:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Because they do. &hellip; We literally count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, up to the majority that wins.</p>

                <p>Given this change of tone, it came as no surprise when on February 1st, Gould's new mandate letter was made public.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>A clear preference for a new electoral system, let alone a consensus, has not emerged. Furthermore, without a clear preference or a clear question, a referendum would not be in Canada’s interest. Changing the electoral system will not be in your mandate.</p>

                    <p>It is because I felt that it was not in the best interest of our country or of our future that I turned my back on that promise. And I know people will be disappointed, yep. But this was my choice to make and I chose to make it with full consequence of the cost that is possibly going to come to it. But I will not compromise on what is in the best interest of Canada. That's what Canadians elected me for.</p>
